		<p><b>Questions Asked Before Starting The Home Buying Process</b></p>
		<button class="accordion"><b>Should I talk with a bank before looking at homes?</b></button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>The answer to the question is YES!  There are tons of reasons why you should talk with a bank and get pre-approved before looking at homes.  First and foremost, talking with a bank before looking at homes can help you understand exactly how much you can afford.  There is no reason to look at homes that are listed for $250,000 if you can only afford up to $200,000.
			If you’re a first time home buyer, talking with a bank before looking at homes is strongly suggested, as there are many first time home buyer programs available.  These programs can vary from state to state and county to county, so knowing exactly what’s available to you, is critical.</p>

		<button class="accordion"><b>Should I buy or continue to rent?</b></button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>Buying a home can be a very solid investment.  This being said, renting can also be a better option for some, depending on the circumstances.  The current interest rates are incredible.  A 30-year FHA mortgage can be locked in at a rate of around 3.5%.  Since the interest rates are so low, it actually can be cheaper to pay a mortgage right now than paying rent.
		  There are questions that you should ask yourself before deciding to buy a home.  One of the most important things to consider is the length you plan on staying in a home, if you were to purchase.  If the answer is only a few years, it’s likely the better decision is to continue renting.  Another question to ask yourself is whether you are ready to take on the additional “responsibilities” of owning a home.  When owning a home there will be general home maintenance that should be done, are you ready for that?
		  Buying a home is a great option in many cases, but not always.</p>

		<button class="accordion"><b>Can I find a rent-to-own property?</b></button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>Can you find a needle in a haystack?  Of course you can, but the probability isn’t very high.  The same can be said about a rent-to-own property.  A common question from home buyers is whether rent-to-owns exist or whether an owner would consider that option.  They are out there, but there are somethings that you need to know before agreeing to a rent-to-own.</p>

		<p><b>Questions Asked While Placing A Purchase Offer</b></p>
		<button class="accordion"><b>How much should I offer the sellers?</b></button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>When buying a home, you are the only one who can determine how much you should offer a seller.  Certainly it’s suggested you ask for your Realtors advice and thoughts, but ultimately you are the only person who can determine how much you should offer.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion"><b>How long does the seller have to respond to my offer?</b></button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>There is not a standard answer to this question.  A purchase offer will have a “life.”  The “life of the offer” can vary from 12 hours to 3 or 4 days.  There are many circumstances that can effect the length of the “life of the offer.”  Your Realtor should know how long of a “life” to give to your offer.  If you’re looking to purchase a home that is newly listed and the possibility of multiple offers exists, a shorter life is recommended.  If the home you’re looking to purchase has been on the market for 3 months and the seller is located out of town, a 2 day “life” maybe necessary and/or recommended.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion"><b>What if my offer is rejected?</b></button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>Deactivation: 
			When a purchase offer is submitted to the seller there are generally four possible responses.  The first is an accepted offer, the second is a counter offer, the third is a rejected offer, and the final is an offer that is not responded to.  If your offer is rejected, meaning the seller says no and doesn’t counter, you have the right to place another offer.  It’s not very common an offer is rejected or not responded to, unless a seller is offended by a low-ball offer.</p>
